**Let's Get Started**

## Road Map

### Start: 

Let's assume we are given a signal x(t), continuous and differentiable.

<em>exempli gratia</em> :

Now, regarding a practical analysis we can't generate a signal such that we get infinite precision. Thus, to address the signals in real life we can use sampling methods that shall render our signal in a very good approximation. Such a method will convert our signal from a continuous domain to a discrete one.

Also let us define a sampling interval T, and we will get a discrete signal x. Formulated as:
